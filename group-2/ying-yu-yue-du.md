## STM32Cube

### Description

stm32cubemx is a grahical tool **that** allows a very easy configuration of STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors,as well as the generation of the corresponding initialization c code for the Arm cortex-M core or a partial linux device tree for arm cortex-a core,through a step-by-step process.

`configuration名词，相对于中文来说强调了configuration，of后面的内容是修饰configuration`

`configuration：the equipment and programs that form a computer system and the way that these are set up to run`

* `Performance will vary depending on your hardware and software`` `**`configurations`**`.`

`the generation of electricity是发电的意思，本文是生成的意思；`

The first step consists in selecting <mark style="color:red;">**either**</mark> an STMicrolectronics STM32 microcontroller, microprocessor or a development platform that matches the required set of peripherals,<mark style="color:red;">**or**</mark> an example running on a specific development platform.

&#x20;`consists in:t`[`o have something as the main or only part or feature`](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/consist-of-in-doing-something.3535143/)``

* `The beauty of the city`` `**`consists in`**` ``its magnificent buildings.`

`either or的分辨，不要跟或搞混了。`

For microprocessors,the second step allows to configure the GPIOs and the clock setup for the whole system,and interactively assign peripherals either to the Arm® Cortex®-M or to the Cortex®-A world.

`interactively:in a way that allows information to be passed continuously and in both directions between a computer or other device and the person who uses it.互动地，以交互方式的`

`either:两者选一`

Specific utilities, such as DDR configuration and tuning, make it easy to get started with STM32 microprocessors.

For Cortex®-M core, the configuration includes additional steps that are exactly similar to those described for microcontrollers.
